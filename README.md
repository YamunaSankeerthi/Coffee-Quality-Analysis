# ☕ Coffee Quality Analysis

This project explores data from the **Coffee Quality Institute** to analyze the key factors influencing **coffee quality**, with a focus on **sensory attributes** like aroma, flavor, acidity, aftertaste, and total cup points.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The dataset provides detailed information on coffee samples, including **processing methods**, **origin regions**, **defects**, and **sensory scores**. By analyzing these aspects, the project helps uncover **what makes high-quality coffee** and provides valuable insights for coffee producers, roasters, and enthusiasts.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the key **factors contributing to higher coffee quality ratings**.
- Analyze relationships between:
  - **Processing methods**
  - **Origin regions**
  - **Defects**
  - **Sensory attributes**
- Use **"What-If" analysis** to predict how changes in sensory parameters could affect overall cup quality.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- **☕ Sensory Analysis:** Evaluation of **aroma, flavor, acidity, aftertaste, body, balance**, and **overall quality**.
- **🔁 Processing Methods:** Compare how **washed, honey, and natural** processing methods affect coffee quality.
- **🌍 Origin Regions:** Insights into how coffee from different **countries/regions** performs in sensory scoring.
- **⚠️ Defect Analysis:** Identify how **primary and secondary defects** impact total cup points.
- **📊 What-If Analysis:** Predictive impact of changing **aroma, acidity, and body** on the final score.

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Processing Methods:**  
  Washed coffee generally scores higher in cleanliness and brightness, while natural processed coffees often have more intense aroma and body.

- **Origin Regions:**  
  Certain countries consistently produce coffee with high flavor and acidity (e.g., Ethiopia, Kenya).

- **Defects Impact:**  
  Primary and secondary defects show a **negative correlation** with overall quality and total cup points.

- **Sensory Trends:**  
  High scores in **aroma + acidity + body** tend to align with better total cup scores.

## 🧪 How to Use This Project

1. **Clone or Download** the repository.
2. **Open the Power BI file** or import the dataset into Power BI Desktop.
3. Use filters/slicers to explore:
   - Sensory scores by origin
   - Impact of processing methods
   - Defects vs cup quality
4. Try **What-If Analysis** to simulate how changing **aroma, acidity, or body** affects the overall score.
